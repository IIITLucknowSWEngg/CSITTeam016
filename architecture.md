## Overview

The Upsolve platform architecture is designed to deliver a responsive, scalable, and secure competitive programming experience. The platform integrates modern frontend and backend technologies, efficient databases, and cloud infrastructure to handle real-time contests, fast code evaluation, and community interactions seamlessly.

## Key Components

- **Frontend**: Built with React, providing an interactive and user-friendly interface that’s responsive across various devices.
  
- **Backend**: Utilizes Golang, Rust, and Node.js to manage different layers of functionality. Each language handles tasks according to its strengths, ensuring efficient data processing and request handling.

- **Databases**: 
  - **Redis** for caching to boost performance and reduce database load.
  - **PostgreSQL** for persistent data storage, handling user data, problem sets, and contest information.

- **Deployment**: Deployed on AWS for cloud scalability, with Docker used for containerization, and Kubernetes for orchestration and management of microservices.
