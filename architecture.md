```plantuml
@startuml
package "Web Interface" {
    class ReactApp {
        +render()
        +handleSubmit()
    }
}

package "Backend API" {
    class NodeApp {
        +handleRequest()
        +validateData()
    }
    class ContestEngine {
        +createContest()
        +manageContest()
    }
    class JudgeSystem {
        +evaluateCode()
    }
    class WalletService {
        +handleTransactions()
        +processPayments()
    }
}

package "Database" {
    class PostgreSQL {
        +storeData()
        +retrieveData()
    }
}

package "Auth Service" {
    class Auth {
        +login()
        +register()
    }
}

package "Payment Processor" {
    class Payment {
        +processEntryFees()
        +distributePrizes()
    }
}

package "Cache Layer" {
    class Redis {
        +cacheData()
        +retrieveCache()
    }
}

ReactApp -> NodeApp : sends request
NodeApp -> ContestEngine : delegates contest logic
NodeApp -> JudgeSystem : delegates code evaluation
NodeApp -> WalletService : handles financial transactions
NodeApp -> PostgreSQL : interacts with database
NodeApp -> Auth : handles authentication
NodeApp -> PaymentProcessor : handles payments
NodeApp -> Redis : caches data
