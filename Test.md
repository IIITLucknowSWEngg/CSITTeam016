## **1. Test Plan**  

### **1.1 Introduction**  
The purpose of this document is to outline the testing strategy, methodology, and test cases for the **Hashcode Online Competitive Programming Platform**, ensuring robust quality standards. This document aims to cover all aspects of testing to ensure a reliable, secure, and user-friendly platform.

---

### **1.2 Test Items**  
- User Management  
- Contest Management  
- Code Evaluation  
- Payment Processing  

---

### **1.3 Features to be Tested**  
- **User Management System**: Registration, login, and profile features.  
- **Contest Management**: Contest creation, participation, and rankings.  
- **Code Evaluation**: Submission, execution, and scoring.  
- **Payment Processing**: Wallet transactions, entry fee payments, and prize distribution.  

---

### **1.4 Features Not to Be Tested**  
- Real-time chat functionality.  
- Offline mode or mobile applications (deferred to future phases).  

---

### **1.5 Testing Approach**  
The testing process includes:  
1. **Unit Testing**: Validating individual modules.  
2. **Integration Testing**: Ensuring proper interactions between components.  
3. **System Testing**: Testing the end-to-end functionality.  
4. **Acceptance Testing**: Validating against user requirements.  
5. **Performance Testing**: Ensuring scalability and responsiveness under load.  
6. **Security Testing**: Verifying the platform's security measures.  
7. **Usability Testing**: Ensuring the platform is user-friendly and accessible.  
8. **Reliability Testing**: Verifying system uptime and error handling.

**Testing Style**: Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) using **Cucumber** for Gherkin-style test scenarios and **Chai** for assertions.  

---

### **1.6 Pass/Fail Criteria**  
A test case is marked as **Pass** if actual outcomes match expected results. A test case is marked as **Fail** if there are deviations, performance issues, or errors.

---

### **1.7 Suspension and Resumption Criteria**  
- Testing will be **suspended** in the event of critical failures (e.g., server crashes, significant defects).  
- Testing will **resume** after defect resolution and retesting of the impacted areas. 

### **1.8 Test Environment**
