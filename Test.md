## 1. Test Plan
### 1.1 Introduction
The purpose of this document is to outline the testing strategy and test cases for the Hashcode platform based on the IEEE-829-2008 standard. This document includes test scenarios written in BDD style using Cucumber and Chai Assertion Library.

### 1.2 Test Items
- User Management
- Contest Management
- Code Evaluation
- Payment Processing

### 1.3 Features to be Tested
- User registration and authentication
- Contest creation and participation
- Code submission and evaluation
- Payment transactions and wallet management

### 1.4 Features not to be Tested
- Real-time chat
- Offline functionality

### 1.5 Approach
The testing approach will include unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing. BDD will be used to write clear and understandable test scenarios.

### 1.6 Pass/Fail Criteria
Test cases will be marked as pass if the actual results match the expected results. Any deviations will be marked as fail.

### 1.7 Suspension and Resumption Criteria
Testing will be suspended if critical defects are identified and resumed once they are resolved.

## 2. Test Design Specification
### 2.1 Test Design Overview
This section outlines the design of the test cases, including the approach and techniques used to verify the functionality of the Hashcode platform.

### 2.2 Test Design Features
- User Management: Verify user registration, login, and profile management.
- Contest Management: Verify contest creation, participation, and result processing.
- Code Evaluation: Verify code submission, execution, and scoring.
- Payment Processing: Verify wallet transactions, entry fee payments, and prize distributions.

## 3. Test Case Specification

### 3.1 User Registration
```gherkin
Feature: User Registration

  Scenario: Successful user registration
    Given a new user is on the registration page
    When the user enters valid registration details
    And the user submits the registration form
    Then the user account should be created
    And a verification email should be sent
```

```javascript
const chai = require('chai');
const expect = chai.expect;

describe('User Registration', () => {
  it('should create a user account and send a verification email', () => {
    const registrationDetails = {
      email: 'user@example.com',
      username: 'newuser',
      password: 'Password123!'
    };
    const result = registerUser(registrationDetails);
    expect(result).to.have.property('success', true);
    expect(result).to.have.property('verificationEmailSent', true);
  });
});
```

### 3.2 Contest Participation
```gherkin
Feature: Contest Participation

  Scenario: Successful contest participation
    Given a registered user is on the contest page
    When the user selects a contest
    And the user pays the entry fee
    Then the user should be enrolled in the contest
    And the contest should be accessible to the user
```

```javascript
describe('Contest Participation', () => {
  it('should enroll the user in the contest and make it accessible', () => {
    const userId = 'user123';
    const contestId = 'contest456';
    const result = enrollInContest(userId, contestId);
    expect(result).to.have.property('enrolled', true);
    expect(result).to.have.property('accessGranted', true);
  });
});
```

### 3.3 Code Evaluation
```gherkin
Feature: Code Evaluation

  Scenario: Successful code submission and evaluation
    Given a user is participating in a contest
    When the user submits a valid code solution
    Then the code should be executed in a sandboxed environment
    And the results should be displayed to the user
```

```javascript
describe('Code Evaluation', () => {
  it('should execute the code in a sandboxed environment and display results', () => {
    const codeSubmission = {
      userId: 'user123',
      contestId: 'contest456',
      code: 'print("Hello, World!")',
      language: 'python'
    };
    const result = evaluateCode(codeSubmission);
    expect(result).to.have.property('executed', true);
    expect(result).to.have.property('resultsDisplayed', true);
  });
});
```

### 3.4 Payment Processing
```gherkin
Feature: Payment Processing

  Scenario: Successful wallet transaction
    Given a user has sufficient funds in their wallet
    When the user initiates a transaction
    Then the transaction should be processed
    And the wallet balance should be updated
```

```javascript
describe('Payment Processing', () => {
  it('should process the transaction and update the wallet balance', () => {
    const transactionDetails = {
      userId: 'user123',
      amount: 10,
      currency: 'USD'
    };
    const result = processTransaction(transactionDetails);
    expect(result).to.have.property('processed', true);
    expect(result.walletBalance).to.be.a('number');
  });
});
```
