# **User Requirements Document (URD) - Codeforces Clone**

## **1. Introduction**

### **1.1 Purpose**
The purpose of this document is to outline the functional and non-functional requirements for the development of a Codeforces Clone platform. The platform will enable users to participate in algorithmic problem-solving contests, practice on a problem archive, and engage in discussions related to competitive programming.

### **1.2 Scope**
This platform aims to serve as a comprehensive solution for competitive programmers, learners, and organisations, providing functionalities such as contest participation, code submission, problem archiving, and user engagement through leaderboards and forums. The platform will offer multi-language code submissions, real-time feedback, and a ranking system.

- Users ranging from beginners to advanced programmers who actively participate in time-constrained algorithmic challenges.
  
### **2.2 Students and Learners**
- Users looking to improve their algorithmic problem-solving skills by practicing regularly and preparing for technical coding interviews.
  
### **2.3 Organisations**
- Companies that organize programming contests to identify skilled individuals for recruitment purposes.

### **2.4 Administrators**
- Users with elevated access privileges to manage the content of the platform, such as contest creation, problem moderation, and user management.

## **3. User Needs**

### **3.1 Contest Participation**

- **Functional Requirement**: The platform must allow users to register for contests and view all available contests. Users should be able to access contest problems and submit solutions within the contest timeframe.
  
- **Non-Functional Requirement**: The contest interface should be responsive and provide real-time updates regarding contest duration and submission status.

### **3.2 Code Submission**

- **Functional Requirement**: Users must be able to write and submit code through a built-in code editor that supports multiple programming languages (e.g., C++, Python, Java). The platform must validate code submissions against predefined test cases.
  
- **Non-Functional Requirement**: The system should ensure rapid processing of code submissions, providing immediate feedback on the results, including success/failure, test case details, and performance metrics.

### **3.3 Problem Archive Access**

- **Functional Requirement**: Users should be able to browse through an archive of problems, filtered by difficulty level, topic, and contest history. Problems must be accessible for practice outside of official contests.
  
- **Non-Functional Requirement**: The problem archive should be searchable and efficiently organized to enable quick access to specific problem sets.

### **3.4 Leaderboard Visibility**

- **Functional Requirement**: The platform must provide a leaderboard displaying user rankings based on contest performance. The leaderboard should update in real-time during contests and provide historical data after the contest ends.
  
- **Non-Functional Requirement**: The leaderboard should be visible to all users and provide an option to filter results by user, region, or organization.

### **3.5 Profile Management**

- **Functional Requirement**: Users should have access to personal profiles where they can view and edit their information, review past contest performances, and track their problem-solving statistics.
  
- **Non-Functional Requirement**: Profile updates should be processed quickly, and all user data (including contest history) should be stored securely.

### **3.6 Discussion Forums**

- **Functional Requirement**: The platform should provide a discussion forum where users can create threads, ask questions, and share solutions or resources related to problems or contests.
  
- **Non-Functional Requirement**: Forums should be moderated to prevent spam, and discussions should be organized logically based on problem tags, difficulty, and recent activity.
