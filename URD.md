# **User Requirements Document (URD) - Codeforces Clone**

## **1. Introduction**

### **1.1 Purpose**
The purpose of this document is to outline the functional and non-functional requirements for the development of a Codeforces Clone platform. The platform will enable users to participate in algorithmic problem-solving contests, practice on a problem archive, and engage in discussions related to competitive programming.

### **1.2 Scope**
This platform aims to serve as a comprehensive solution for competitive programmers, learners, and organisations, providing functionalities such as contest participation, code submission, problem archiving, and user engagement through leaderboards and forums. The platform will offer multi-language code submissions, real-time feedback, and a ranking system.

## **2. User Characteristics**

### **2.1 Competitive Programmers**
- Users ranging from beginners to advanced programmers who actively participate in time-constrained algorithmic challenges.
  
### **2.2 Students and Learners**
- Users looking to improve their algorithmic problem-solving skills by practicing regularly and preparing for technical coding interviews.
  
### **2.3 Organisations**
- Companies that organize programming contests to identify skilled individuals for recruitment purposes.

### **2.4 Administrators**
- Users with elevated access privileges to manage the content of the platform, such as contest creation, problem moderation, and user management.

## **3. User Needs**

### **3.1 Contest Participation**

- **Functional Requirement**: The platform must allow users to register for contests and view all available contests. Users should be able to access contest problems and submit solutions within the contest timeframe.
  
- **Non-Functional Requirement**: The contest interface should be responsive and provide real-time updates regarding contest duration and submission status.

### **3.2 Code Submission**

- **Functional Requirement**: Users must be able to write and submit code through a built-in code editor that supports multiple programming languages (e.g., C++, Python, Java). The platform must validate code submissions against predefined test cases.
  
- **Non-Functional Requirement**: The system should ensure rapid processing of code submissions, providing immediate feedback on the results, including success/failure, test case details, and performance metrics.

### **3.3 Problem Archive Access**

- **Functional Requirement**: Users should be able to browse through an archive of problems, filtered by difficulty level, topic, and contest history. Problems must be accessible for practice outside of official contests.
  
- **Non-Functional Requirement**: The problem archive should be searchable and efficiently organized to enable quick access to specific problem sets.

### **3.4 Leaderboard Visibility**

- **Functional Requirement**: The platform must provide a leaderboard displaying user rankings based on contest performance. The leaderboard should update in real-time during contests and provide historical data after the contest ends.
  
- **Non-Functional Requirement**: The leaderboard should be visible to all users and provide an option to filter results by user, region, or organization.

### **3.5 Profile Management**

- **Functional Requirement**: Users should have access to personal profiles where they can view and edit their information, review past contest performances, and track their problem-solving statistics.
  
- **Non-Functional Requirement**: Profile updates should be processed quickly, and all user data (including contest history) should be stored securely.

### **3.6 Discussion Forums**

- **Functional Requirement**: The platform should provide a discussion forum where users can create threads, ask questions, and share solutions or resources related to problems or contests.
  
- **Non-Functional Requirement**: Forums should be moderated to prevent spam, and discussions should be organized logically based on problem tags, difficulty, and recent activity.

## **4. System Requirements**

### **4.1 Usability**

- **Requirement**: The platform must provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface, ensuring that even new users can navigate the site with ease.
  
- **Evaluation**: User feedback and usability tests will be used to evaluate the platformâ€™s design.

### **4.2 Performance**

- **Requirement**: The platform must be able to handle a large number of concurrent users, especially during contests, without significant latency or downtime.
  
- **Evaluation**: Performance tests and load tests will be conducted to ensure scalability.

### **4.3 Security**

- **Requirement**: User data, including personal profiles and code submissions, must be securely stored and transmitted. The system must prevent unauthorized access and guard against common security vulnerabilities such as SQL injections and cross-site scripting (XSS).
  
- **Evaluation**: Regular security audits will be performed.

### **4.4 Reliability**

- **Requirement**: The platform should be available 99.9% of the time, especially during active contests. In case of unexpected downtime, the platform must provide a reliable method for contest resumption.
  
- **Evaluation**: Monitoring tools will track system uptime, and redundancy mechanisms will ensure continuity of service.

## **5. User Interface Requirements**

### **5.1 Contest Page**
- A contest page where users can view problems, submit code, and monitor their submissions in real-time.
- The page must display time remaining for the contest and update the leaderboard.

### **5.2 Code Editor**
- The code editor should support syntax highlighting, auto-indentation, and error checking for multiple programming languages.

### **5.3 Leaderboard**
- A clear display of rankings during and after contests, with filtering options based on user, country, and organization.

### **5.4 Discussion Forum**
- An organized structure for discussions, with thread creation and tagging features.

---

## **6. Constraints**

- **Scalability**: The platform must scale efficiently to handle thousands of simultaneous users during contests without compromising performance.
- **Cross-browser Compatibility**: The platform should work seamlessly across different web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.).
- **Mobile Support**: A mobile-friendly version of the platform should be available, allowing users to participate in contests and browse problems from their mobile devices.
