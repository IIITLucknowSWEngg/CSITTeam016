# *Software Requirements Specification (SRS) - Codeforces Clone*

## *1. Introduction*
The Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for the Codeforces Clone project outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for the development of a competitive programming platform.
The system is designed to allow users to participate in contests, solve problems, and receive automated feedback on their solutions.

## *2. Functional Requirements*
### *2.1 User Registration and Authentication*
- *Description*: Users must be able to register using their email, GitHub, or Google accounts. Once registered, they should be able to log in securely.
- *Input*: Registration form data (username, email, password).
- *Output*: User account creation, email confirmation.

### *2.2 Contest Management*
- *Description*: Admins can create and schedule contests with varying levels of problems. Users can participate in these contests and view problems during the contest period.
- *Input*: Contest details (title, start time, end time).
- *Output*: Contest is available for users to participate.

### *2.3 Code Submission and Evaluation*
- *Description*: Users will submit their code for automatic evaluation. The system will check the code against predefined test cases and provide results.
- *Input*: Code submissions from the user.
- *Output*: Test case results (pass/fail) and feedback on performance.

### *2.4 Leaderboard*
- *Description*: Display a real-time leaderboard showing rankings based on problem-solving accuracy and speed during contests.
- *Output*: Ranked list of participants.

## *3. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)*
### *3.1 Performance*
- The system should handle up to 10,000 concurrent users during a contest without significant delays.
  
### *3.2 Scalability*
- The platform must scale easily to accommodate increasing numbers of users and contest problems.

### *3.3 Security*
- Implement strong encryption for user passwords and ensure secure transmission of data over HTTPS.

### *3.4 Usability*
- The platform should be intuitive, with clear navigation for new users, and mobile responsive for easy access on different devices.

### *3.5 Availability*
- The system must ensure 99.9% uptime, especially during active contests, with backup mechanisms in place for handling unexpected downtimes.

### *3.6 Extensibility*
- The codebase should be designed to easily incorporate future features, such as additional programming languages or enhanced contest types.
