# **Software Requirements Specification (SRS) - Codeforces Clone**

## **1. Introduction**
The Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document outlines the essential functionalities and performance criteria for the development of a **Codeforces Clone**, a competitive programming platform designed for hosting coding contests. The platform will provide users with the ability to solve algorithmic problems, submit code, and receive automated feedback in real-time. The objective is to build a system capable of handling a large user base, including students, professionals, and competitive programmers. 

### **Key Features:**
- **Real-time Contests**: Allow users to compete in timed programming challenges.
- **Automatic Grading**: Evaluate code submissions instantly against predefined test cases.
- **Rankings and Prizes**: Reward users based on their performance, with a leaderboard that ranks users and prizes for top participants.

### **Vision**:
The vision is to create a robust and scalable platform that motivates competitive programmers to excel by rewarding the top performers and providing a friendly yet challenging coding environment. Unlike traditional platforms, our system will offer **customized contest formats**, **prizes**, and **real-time feedback** that foster an engaging learning experience.

### **Scope**:
The platform will serve both individual and group participants, offering various contest types, programming languages, and integration with third-party tools like GitHub for authentication. Future versions will include support for **team-based competitions**, **multiple contest formats** (e.g., hackathons), and **custom problem creation** by users.

## **2. Functional Requirements**

### **2.1 User Registration and Authentication**
- **Description**: Users must register using their email, GitHub, or Google accounts. They will be able to log in using their registered credentials securely.
- **Input**: Registration form (username, email, password) or social authentication tokens.
- **Output**: Successful account creation, email confirmation, or social login confirmation.
- **Security Considerations**: Encrypted passwords and OAuth 2.0 for third-party login integrations.

### **2.2 Contest Management**
- **Description**: Admins can create, schedule, and manage contests of varying difficulty. Users will participate and solve problems within the time limits.
- **Input**: Contest details like title, start and end times, problem sets, and difficulty levels.
- **Output**: Published contests ready for participation.
- **Features**:
  - **Multiple Problem Types**: Easy, Medium, Hard.
  - **Live Contest Monitoring**: Admins can monitor participants in real-time.
  - **Contest Announcements**: Automated notifications sent before contest begins.

### **2.3 Code Submission and Evaluation**
- **Description**: The system will allow users to submit code solutions which are then evaluated against predefined test cases. Results will be displayed immediately.
- **Input**: User-submitted code in supported languages (e.g., C++, Python, Java).
- **Output**: Real-time feedback, pass/fail status, and performance metrics (execution time, memory usage).
- **Evaluation System**:
  - **Automated Grading**: Uses a sandbox to run code and check against multiple test cases.
  - **Feedback**: Users will receive both pass/fail results and detailed error explanations when possible.
  - **Code Limits**: Restrict submission size and execution time to avoid overload.

### **2.4 Leaderboard**
- **Description**: The leaderboard will display real-time rankings based on user performance, factoring in both the accuracy and speed of problem-solving.
- **Output**: A dynamic list of ranked participants, which updates as users submit solutions.
- **Ranking Algorithm**:
  - **Scoring**: Based on the number of problems solved and the time taken.
  - **Tiebreakers**: Solving time is used as a tiebreaker when participants have solved the same number of problems.

### **2.5 Prize Distribution System**
- **Description**: Users who achieve top positions in the leaderboard will receive rewards.
- **Input**: Leaderboard rankings at the end of each contest.
- **Output**: Automated email notifications and prize credits to winning participants.
- **Features**:
  - **Types of Prizes**: Digital gift cards, certifications, and badges.
  - **Eligibility**: Top 3 or top 10 based on the contest rules.
  - **Prize Redemption**: Users can claim their prizes through the platform.

## **3. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)**

### **3.1 Performance**
- The platform should handle high traffic, supporting up to **10,000 concurrent users** during peak contest times without delays or crashes.
- **Load Testing**: Conduct stress tests to ensure performance under heavy loads.
- **Latency**: The system must maintain response times of less than 1 second for all major functionalities (e.g., code submission, leaderboard updates).

### **3.2 Scalability**
- The system architecture must be horizontally scalable, allowing for **increased user capacity** and additional resources (e.g., servers) as user demand grows.
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Consider AWS or Google Cloud for automatic scaling.

### **3.3 Security**
- Implement strong security measures, including **password encryption** and **HTTPS** for secure data transmission.
- **Data Privacy**: Ensure that user information is securely stored and only accessible by authorized personnel.
- **OWASP Compliance**: Regular audits to check for vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting.

### **3.4 Usability**
- The platform must provide an **intuitive user interface** with easy navigation and **mobile responsiveness**.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure the platform is accessible for users with disabilities (WCAG 2.1 compliance).
- **User Onboarding**: Provide new users with tutorials and onboarding tips to get started with the platform.

### **3.5 Availability**
- Ensure **99.9% uptime** during contest periods with automatic failover and recovery mechanisms to handle unexpected downtimes.
- **Backup Systems**: Daily backups of the database and contest results to prevent data loss.

### **3.6 Extensibility**
- The platform’s design must be modular to accommodate new features such as **additional programming languages** (e.g., Rust, Go), new types of contests (e.g., **team-based contests**), and **custom problem creation** by users.
- **Plugin Support**: Allow developers to create third-party plugins or tools that can extend the functionality of the platform.

### **3.7 Documentation**
- Comprehensive **API documentation** for developers to interact with the platform’s functionalities.
- **User Manuals**: Provide detailed manuals for both end-users and administrators to navigate and manage the platform.
