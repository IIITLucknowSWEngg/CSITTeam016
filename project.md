## Introduction

In today's digital age, competitive programming has become an essential skill for software developers. Our team is developing Hashcode, a platform that brings the thrill of algorithmic problem-solving to programmers of all skill levels, with a unique monetization twist.

Based on our research of existing platforms and user feedback, we identified key pain points in current solutions:
- Complex user interfaces that intimidate newcomers, making it difficult for beginners to explore or practice.
- Limited feedback on incorrect submissions, resulting in slower learning and discouragement.
- Lack of structured learning paths that help users navigate topics progressively.
- Inconsistent judging systems which can lead to frustration with unfair or inaccurate scoring.
- Limited motivation and engagement beyond learning and ranking.

## Vision Statement

> "To create an accessible and innovative competitive programming platform that combines robust learning experiences with exciting monetary challenges, empowering developers to grow their skills and earn rewards."

Our goal is to revolutionize competitive programming by offering an intuitive, engaging platform that not only educates but also provides tangible economic incentives for excellence.
