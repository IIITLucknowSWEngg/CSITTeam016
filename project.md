## Introduction

In today's digital age, competitive programming has become an essential skill for software developers. Our team is developing CodeForces Arena, a platform that brings the thrill of algorithmic problem-solving to programmers of all skill levels.

Based on our research of existing platforms and user feedback, we identified key pain points in current solutions:
- Complex user interfaces that intimidate newcomers
- Limited feedback on incorrect submissions
- Lack of structured learning paths
- Inconsistent judging systems

## Vision Statement

> "To create an accessible yet powerful competitive programming platform that combines the robustness of established platforms with modern user experience design principles."

## Core Features

### 1. User Management System 👥
- Smart authentication with email verification
- OAuth integration (Google, GitHub)
- Personalized user profiles with solving statistics
- Custom rating system based on contest performance

### 2. Contest Environment ⚔️

    D --> E[Leaderboard Update]
```

Key components:
- Real-time contest participation
- Dynamic problem difficulty scaling
- Anti-cheating measures
- Automated evaluation system

### 3. Problem Archive 📚

  - Easy (800-1100)
  - Medium (1200-1500)
  - Hard (1600+)
- Topic-wise organization
- Solution hints and editorial access
- Practice mode with unlimited attempts

### 4. Code Evaluation Engine 🔄
- Support for multiple languages:
  ```
  - Python 3.8+
  - C++ 17/20
  - Java 11/17
  - JavaScript (Node.js)
  ```
- Sandboxed execution environment
- Custom test case support
- Detailed error reporting

### 5. Community Features 🤝
