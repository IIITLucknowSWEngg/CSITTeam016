## Introduction

In today's digital age, competitive programming has become an essential skill for software developers. Our team is developing Upsolve, a platform that brings the thrill of algorithmic problem-solving to programmers of all skill levels.

Based on our research of existing platforms and user feedback, we identified key pain points in current solutions:
- Complex user interfaces that intimidate newcomers, making it difficult for beginners to explore or practice.
- Limited feedback on incorrect submissions, resulting in slower learning and discouragement.
- Lack of structured learning paths that help users navigate topics progressively.
- Inconsistent judging systems which can lead to frustration with unfair or inaccurate scoring.

## Vision Statement

> "To create an accessible yet powerful competitive programming platform that combines the robustness of established platforms with modern user experience design principles."

Our goal is to bridge the gap between beginner-friendly and professional-level competitive programming sites by offering intuitive navigation, meaningful feedback, and engaging content for continuous skill development.

## Core Features

### 1. User Management System 👥

A robust user management system that prioritizes security, personalization, and ease of access:
- **Smart Authentication**: Includes multi-factor authentication and email verification for security.
- **OAuth Integration**: Allows users to log in with Google, GitHub, or other supported services, minimizing friction for new users.
- **Personalized Profiles**: Users will have a comprehensive dashboard displaying solved problems, language preferences, skill ratings, and achievement badges.
- **Custom Rating System**: Similar to Codeforces, the rating system adjusts based on contest performance, providing an ongoing, competitive element.

### 2. Contest Environment ⚔️

The contest environment is designed to replicate the competitive experience:
```mermaid

    A[User Joins Contest] --> B[Problem Selection]
    B --> C[Code Submission]
    C --> D[Real-time Evaluation]
    D --> E[Leaderboard Update]
```
Key components:
- **Real-time Contest Participation**: Users can join ongoing contests and see their rank update live.
- **Dynamic Problem Difficulty Scaling**: Problems are ranked according to difficulty, with scores weighted to reward those solving tougher challenges.
- **Anti-cheating Measures**: Prevents unfair practices using plagiarism detection and IP-based monitoring.
- **Automated Evaluation System**: Judging is handled by a highly optimized evaluation engine with low latency, ensuring accurate results.

### 3. Problem Archive 📚

A categorized problem archive ensures users can practice effectively:
- **Difficulty-based Categorization**: Problems range from Easy (800-1100), Medium (1200-1500), to Hard (1600+).
- **Topic-wise Organization**: Users can search by topics such as graphs, dynamic programming, sorting, and data structures.
- **Solution Hints and Editorials**: Provides hints and detailed explanations for problems, aiding in learning.
- **Practice Mode**: Users can attempt problems multiple times and get instant feedback, allowing unlimited practice.

### 4. Code Evaluation Engine 🔄

A robust code execution engine ensures consistent performance:
- **Multi-language Support**: Supports Python 3.8+, C++ 17/20, Java 11/17, and JavaScript (Node.js), allowing flexibility for programmers.
- **Sandboxed Execution Environment**: Isolates user code to prevent malicious activity and ensures accurate grading.
- **Custom Test Case Support**: Users can test their code with custom inputs to validate logic.
- **Detailed Error Reporting**: Provides comprehensive error messages to help users understand issues in their code.

### 5. Community Features 🤝

Community features foster collaboration and learning:
- **Discussion Forums**: Each problem will have a dedicated discussion forum, allowing users to seek help and share insights.
- **Editorial Writing System**: Users can contribute solutions and tutorials, fostering a collaborative learning environment.
- **User Blogs and Tutorials**: Experienced programmers can write blogs on advanced topics, adding value to the community.
- **Achievement System**: Users earn achievements based on their activity, encouraging regular participation and progression.

    A[Web Interface] -->|HTTP/WebSocket| B[Application Server]
    B --> C[Authentication Service]
    B --> D[Contest Manager]
    B --> E[Code Executor]
    E -->|Sandbox| F[Judge System]
    B --> G[Database]
    B --> H[Cache Layer]
```

- **Web Interface**: Provides an interactive UI, powered by React or Vue.js, ensuring a smooth user experience.
- **Application Server**: Manages requests and maintains contest and user data.
- **Authentication Service**: Secures logins and manages user sessions.
- **Contest Manager**: Controls contest activities and monitors active users.
- **Code Executor**: A dedicated service for evaluating submissions in a secure, sandboxed environment.
