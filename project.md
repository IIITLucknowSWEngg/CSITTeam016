# *Project Description - Codeforces Clone*

## *1. Project Overview*
The Codeforces Clone is a web-based competitive programming platform designed to provide users with an environment for solving algorithmic and programming problems under timed constraints. It aims to emulate the functionalities of Codeforces, one of the most popular platforms in competitive programming. Users will be able to participate in contests, solve problems from an archive, submit their code for automated judging, and view leaderboards for performance comparison. The platform will support multiple programming languages and include a user-friendly interface for seamless contest participation.

## *2. Project Scope*
### *2.1 Included Features*
1. *User Registration and Authentication*: Users can sign up and log in using email or OAuth-based systems (Google, GitHub).
2. *Contest Participation*: 
    - Users can join real-time contests with problems of varying difficulty levels.
    - Problems will be presented with a timer to ensure fair and time-bound participation.
3. *Code Submission and Evaluation*: 
    - Users can submit solutions in multiple programming languages.
    - Automatic evaluation will be performed based on predefined test cases.
4. *Leaderboard System*: Displays ranking based on speed and accuracy of problem-solving during contests.
5. *Problem Archive*: A repository of problems categorized by difficulty, topic, and user status (solved/unsolved).
6. *Discussion Forums*: A space where users can discuss problem solutions, strategies, and improve their skills through interaction.
7. *Admin Interface*: Admins can manage the platform, add new problems, and host contests.
8. *Multi-language Code Editor*: Users will be provided with a code editor supporting syntax highlighting for various programming languages.

### *2.2 Excluded Features*
1. *Problem Generation by Users*: Users will not have access to create new problems. Only admins can add new problems to the platform.
2. *Advanced IDE Integration*: The system will provide a simple, built-in code editor but will not support deep integrations with external IDEs like Visual Studio Code.
3. *Real-Time User Chat*: Real-time chat between participants during contests is not included in the scope.
4. *Customizable Contests by Users*: Users cannot create or customize their contests. Contests will be defined by admins only.
5. *Reward System*: The platform will not implement a complex reward or points system for participants beyond the contest rankings.
